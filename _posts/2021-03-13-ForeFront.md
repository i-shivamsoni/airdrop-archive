## Eligibility Criteria

The FF airdrop allocations were determined based on the number of unique social tokens held, with a **minimum token requirement** for access to token-permissioned groups.

- Users qualified for the airdrop if they met the minimum social token threshold required to join the token-permissioned chat.
- If no specific threshold was set, the **default minimum was 10 tokens** (except for $RLY).
- The **airdrop snapshot was taken on March 12, 2021, at 12 PM UTC**, before the Roll social token hack, ensuring an accurate representation of the community.

#### **Minimum Token Requirements**

To qualify for the airdrop, wallets needed to hold at least:

- **FWB:** 55 tokens
- **JAMM:** 1000 tokens
- **WHALE:** 17 tokens
- **Other tokens:** Default minimum of 10 (except $RLY)

#### **Allocation Breakdown**

- **Base Allocation:** Each qualifying wallet received **~238 FF per eligible social token held**.
- **Bonus Multipliers:**
  - **SWAGG holders:** 2x allocation
  - **FWB holders:** 1.25x allocation
  - **WHALE holders:** 1.15x allocation
- **Stacking Allocations:** If a wallet held multiple eligible tokens, the base allocations stacked rather than being capped at 238 FF.
  This structure ensured a fair and proportional distribution of FF tokens among the social token community.
