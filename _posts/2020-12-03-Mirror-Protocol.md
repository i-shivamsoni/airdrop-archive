## Additional Information

- MIR is used for governance within Mirror Protocol, enabling token holders to propose and vote on changes.
- No admin keys or privileged access; governance is entirely decentralized.
- Tokens can be earned via:
  - **Providing liquidity** for MIR/UST pairs on Terraswap or Uniswap.
  - **Staking LUNA** to earn MIR rewards.
  - **Providing liquidity** for mAsset/UST pairs on decentralized exchanges.
- The total MIR supply follows an inflationary schedule, increasing annually until Year 4.
- MIR staking and liquidity provision rewards vary in risk and reward potential, with MIR/UST pairs yielding the highest but carrying impermanent loss risk.
