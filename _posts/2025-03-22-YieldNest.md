## Additional Information

- **Claiming Process:** Once the airdrop is live, users will need to connect their wallets to the official YieldNest app and visit the airdrop claim page. The official link will be announced via YieldNest's official Twitter once the Token Generation Event (TGE) is live. Users are advised to ensure they are on the correct YieldNest domain ([https://www.yieldnest.finance](https://www.yieldnest.finance)) and to avoid any sites claiming to offer early claims, as they are not safe.

- **Post-Airdrop Participation:** After the airdrop, YND token holders can participate in governance by staking YND for veYND, voting on incentive allocations and governance proposals, and earning additional rewards. There is also an option to delegate voting power via StakeDAO for a more hands-off approach.

- **Security Reminder:** YieldNest will never ask users to send funds to claim tokens. Users should always double-check what they are signing and ignore direct messages pretending to be official claim links.
