- Airdrop amounts are calculated based on a predefined formula in the proposal.
- Users who have already claimed cannot claim again.

## Claiming Process

1. **Check eligibility**

   - Find your address in the [official eligibility list](https://lido.fi) and note your index.
   - If your address is not on the list, you are not eligible.

   - In the **"Contract/Read Contract"** tab, find the `isClaimed` method.
   - Enter your index and press **Query**.
   - If the result is `false`, you can proceed. If `true`, your airdrop has already been claimed.

3. **Claim LDO tokens**
   - Open **"Contract/Write Contract"** on Etherscan.
