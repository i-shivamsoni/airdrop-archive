## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for the Polyhedra Network airdrop, users can participate in the following activities:

- **Minting and Bridging NFTs**: Users can create NFTs on supported blockchains and transfer them using zkBridge. This process involves setting up the Binance Web3 Wallet, creating an NFT on a chosen network, and using zkBridge to transfer the NFT to another supported network. citeturn0search1

- **Bridging Tokens**: Users can transfer tokens such as BNB, USDT, or ETH between supported blockchains using zkBridge. This involves connecting the Binance Web3 Wallet to zkBridge, selecting the source and destination networks, specifying the amount to transfer, and confirming the transaction. citeturn0search1
