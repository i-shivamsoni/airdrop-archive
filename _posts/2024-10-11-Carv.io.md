- **Infinite Play Participation**: Engaging in **CARVâ€™s gaming platform** can boost eligibility.
- **.Play Name Service**: Users with **shorter .play names** who stay active will receive higher rewards.
- **Binding Web2 & Web3 Accounts**: Linking **Steam, Twitter, Discord, and wallets** increases your **$SOUL mining rate and airdrop eligibility**.
