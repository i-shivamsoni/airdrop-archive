## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for the airdrop, users needed to meet the following conditions:

- **Wallet Requirement:** Users had to hold Ethereum (ETH) in a wallet they controlled. ETH stored on centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance did not qualify.
- **Minimum Balance:** Ethereum addresses must have held more than **0.1 ETH** (strictly greater than 0.1 ETH, not "0.1 ETH or more") at the time of the snapshot.
- **Snapshot Date:** The snapshot was taken at **Ethereum block height 3988888** (July 7, 2017, at approximately 16:36 UTC).
- **Proportional rewardedActivity:** OMG tokens were distributed **proportionally to ETH holdings** at the time of the snapshot.
- **No Claim Required:** Tokens were automatically sent to eligible wallets. Users only needed to check their wallet or add the token contract to view their balance.

## Additional Information

- OmiseGO later rebranded as **OMG Network** and was subsequently tied to **Boba Network**.
- The goal of the airdrop was to encourage participation in OmiseGOâ€™s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system and promote broader token distribution within the Ethereum community.
- The OMG Plasma chain was designed as a scaling solution for Ethereum, allowing fast and cheap transactions.
- Many recipients received very small amounts due to the vast number of eligible addresses.
