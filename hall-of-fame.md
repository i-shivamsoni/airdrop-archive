## Introduction

This document ranks and categorizes the most significant cryptocurrency airdrops in history based on five key criteria:

The Top 10 table is now rendered dynamically from YAML front matter

1. **Historical Impact**: How the airdrop influenced subsequent token distribution models and set precedents in the industry
2. **Total Value Distributed**: The approximate total value of tokens distributed (typically measured at all-time high prices)
3. **Distribution Fairness**: How equitably tokens were distributed among participants and the accessibility of the airdrop
4. **Innovation**: Novel approaches to eligibility criteria, distribution mechanisms, or governance implementation
5. **Long-term Success**: The continued relevance, value, and ecosystem development following the airdrop

These rankings reflect both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments based on comprehensive research of each project's distribution mechanics, subsequent performance, and lasting influence on the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Table will be rendered here by layout/JS

## Methodology
Rankings in this Hall of Fame are based on comprehensive analysis of multiple data sources, including project documentation, third-party research reports, and market data. Values are typically calculated based on all-time high (ATH) token prices, which represents the maximum potential value recipients could have realized, though actual realized value likely differs significantly. For recent airdrops (2023-2025), long-term success assessments are necessarily preliminary and subject to revision as these projects mature. -->
