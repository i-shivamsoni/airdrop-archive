The **Airdrop Criteria Archive** was created to document and analyze historical airdrop distribution criteria used by blockchain projects. Our mission is to provide an educational resource that helps the community understand how airdrops work, what criteria projects use to distribute tokens, and how to analyze past distributions to better understand future opportunities.
