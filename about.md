# About Airdrop Archive

Welcome to the most comprehensive archive of crypto airdrops. Our mission is to document, analyze, and preserve the history of token distributions in the cryptocurrency space.

## Our Story

Started in 2024, Airdrop Archive was born from a simple observation: while airdrops have become a crucial part of crypto token distribution, there was no centralized, well-documented history of these events. We set out to change that.

## What We Do

### Documentation
- Comprehensive records of airdrop events
- Detailed eligibility criteria
- Distribution methods and results
- Historical context and impact

### Analysis
- Success metrics
- Community impact
- Market performance
- Distribution fairness

### Education

- Best practices
- Security guidelines
- Historical lessons

## Our Values

### Accuracy
We strive to maintain the highest standards of accuracy in our documentation. Every airdrop entry is thoroughly researched and verified.

### Transparency
We believe in complete transparency. Our methodology, data sources, and analysis criteria are all openly documented.

### Community Focus
We prioritize community impact and fair distribution in our analysis. We believe airdrops should benefit the broader crypto ecosystem.
